			<article>
				<p>The purpose for the redesign of this site is to provide visitors with a more streamlined, user friendly site. This will be accoplished by condensing the site down to 6 primary pages, by providing a user friendly interface (navigation system) and by designing the site in a way that makes the page more interactive and friendly. The sites overall design will be focused on the target audience's needs and tastes.</p>
				<p>Responsive web design will be used in order to maximize the use of available screen real-estate, while still allowing visitors to utilize the site from any web-connected device they have access to. Common design techniques will be leveraged to better enhance the user's experience to the site, and encourage them to use the site more frequently.</p>

			<header><h2>Competitive Analysis</h2></header>
			<article>
				<p>Study of other elementary schools around the country has showed that most visitors were female between the ages of 25 and 54. From each of other schools, site traffic was driven primarily by search engine queries. Implementing a sound SEO strategy, as well as designing the site to be more appealing to a slightly younger crowd of mothers should increase the overall traffic. The average time spent on this site is longer for this site than other sites analyzed, which is not necessarily a good thing when considering a target audience with limited time. This is indicative of a site that is poorly structured, causing visitors to spend more time looking for the information they need.</p>
				<p>Using proper SEO to drive in new traffic, designing the site to appeal to a wider target audience, and organizing the information in a manner that is easy to find should increase the functionality of this site drastically.</p>

			<article>
				<p>Based on statistical information gained researching the current site as well as the sites of other schools around the country, the targeted audience consists of primarily mothers between the ages of 35 and 44. Browsing is generally done at home. This demographic can be further refined into two primary groups.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Mothers with children currently enrolled in the school who need information concerning their child's enrollment.</li>
						<li>Mothers who are thinking of enrolling their children in the school who need information concerning the school, it's staff, etc.</li> 
					</ul>
				
				<h3>Mothers with children currently enrolled in the school:</h3>	
				<div class="thumbnail"><img src="img/jessica.jpg" alt="Jessica" title="Jessica"/></div>
				<p>Jessica is a married 32 year old mother who works full time as an accountant. She uses the website to keep current on what is going on at her child's school, and to check for any breaking announcements such as class cancellation. She also uses the site find out important dates, such as PTA meetings or conferences, and will occasionally browse the site to get the phone number when she is at work and does not have access to her cell phone.</p>
				<p>When not at work, Jessica leads a very busy life. Both of her kids are involved in extra-curricular activities and as such, she spends most of her time on the site from either her smartphone or her iPad, depending on where she is at.</p>
				<h3>Mothers who are thinking of enrolling the student in the school:</h3>	
				<div class="thumbnail"><img src="img/emily.jpg" alt="Emily" title="Emily"/></div>
				<p>Emily is a 38 year old single mother who is considering moving her family into an area where her kids will attend this school. She is moving from out of state, and as such is unable to see then school first hand. She is very serious about her children's education, and wants to make sure that her kids will be attending a school she approves of. She uses her home computer for most of her web browsing, although it is primarily for social networking and sharing pictures of her kids with her family. Her visits to the site are generally to look at things such as school policy, the school's achievements, and to get other information such as how involved the school is in the community. She spends as much time as she can researching, but being a single mother time is a rare thing.</p>
